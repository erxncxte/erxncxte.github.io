            <p>With the itch to move back to ICE, I was part of a group of 8 students who ran the '22 Combustion vehicle as "RR EVO" in the 2024 FSAE competition. We made a lot of changes to the vehicle, including much needed repairs, throttle mapping, engine tuning, a new exhaust, and stronger aero.</p>
            <p>We spent 4 months putting the car back together and testing it, before coming 1st in the competition. This was definitely my most rewarding year in FSAE. I felt that my team worked really well together, and we were able to problem solve efficiently. One of my favourite memories of competition, is finding out that our wiring in the steering column has broken, and the steering wheel was cutting out whenever our driver turned a corner, which meant he couldn't shift gears. We pulled the car into the pits, and with 10 minutes to spare, all worked together to solder the cables back together, in hopes that it would survive our last dynamic event. (It did!!)</p>

        <div class="rmitmotorsport">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall 11th in EV Class</li>

            <p>Following on from 2022, the Combustion and Electric Racing Teams combined to what is now known as RMIT Motorsport. This year, I lead the Low Voltage Electronics sub-team to produce a wiring harness and sensor system for an Electric Vehicle. I learnt a lot about how EVs work and gained more of an appreciation for the engineering behind them.</p>
            <p>At Competition, we placed 11th in the EV class and we were the top performing university from Victoria. Depsite having over-current issues, our drivers kept a steady pace which allowed us to finish all dynamic events and resulted in a better placement than intially expected.</p>
            <p>This year I also made my first PCB. It's purpose is to display some LEDs on the Dash to alert the driver of any faults that may occur in the car. It is a safety feature for rules and also helps with debugging. I learnt a lot about using Altium and how to route a board and look forward to designing more.</p>

        <h1 style="color: red;">RMIT Racing | 2022</h1>
        <div class="rmitracing">
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall 2nd in ICE Class</li>
                <li>1st Place Endurance</li>

            </ul>
            <p>At the beginning of 2022, I joined the RMIT Racing team, hoping to learn some skills and build on my knowledge in the realm of electronics. In August, I was promoted to Head Electrical Engineer and guided my team to complete a wiring harness for our FSAE Combustion Car to compete in December 2022 for the last time as a combustion team.</p>
            <p>This project was a huge learning curve for me as the only experience I had with electronics stemmed from my part-time job at Jaycar Electronics and personal hobby-level experience. A lot of problem-solving was done to get this car up and running. I spent a lot of time splicing, crimping and reading data-sheets to correct mistakes. I also participated in the Chassis Dyno where we tested the car and coded all of the MoTeC ECU and PDM dependencies through M1 tune.</p>
            <p>At the 2022 FSAE Competition in Winton, we placed 2nd in the Combustion category and 1st in the Endurance event after problem-solving to get the car running at the last possible minute! In 2023, I will continue on as the Head Electrical Engineer with a new merged team, RMIT Motorsport, where we will be producing a new EV car.</p>
