    <h1 style="color: red;">RMIT Racing | 2022</h1>
    <p>At the beginning of 2022, I joined the RMIT Racing team, hoping to learn some skills and build on my knowledge in the realm of electronics. In August, I was promoted to Head Electrical Engineer and guided my team to complete a wiring harness for our FSAE Combustion Car to compete in December 2022 for the last time as a combustion team.</p>
    <p>This project was a huge learning curve for me as the only experience I had with electronics stemmed from my part-time job at Jaycar Electronics and personal hobby-level experience. A lot of problem-solving was done to get this car up and running. I spent a lot of time splicing, crimping and reading data-sheets to correct mistakes. I also participated in the Chassis Dyno where we tested the car and coded all of the MoTeC ECU and PDM dependencies through M1 tune.</p>
    <p>At the 2022 FSAE Competition in Winton, we placed 2nd in the Combustion category and 1st in the Endurance event after problem-solving to get the car running at the last possible minute! In 2023, I will continue on as the Head Electrical Engineer with a new merged team, RMIT Motorsport, where we will be producing a new EV car.</p>
    <p>Below are some photos of my work throughout the year!</p>

    <p>Following on from 2022, the Combustion and Electric Racing Teams combined to what is now known as RMIT Motorsport. This year, I lead the Low Voltage Electronics sub-team to produce a wiring harness and sensor system for an Electric Vehicle. I learnt a lot about how EVs work and gained more of an appreciation for the engineering behind them.</p>
    <p>At Competition, we placed 5th out of all the participating universities and we were the top performing university from Victoria. Depsite having over-current issues, our drivers kept a steady pace which allowed us to finish all dynamic events and resulted in a better placement than intially expected.</p>
    <p>This year I also made my first PCB. It's purpose is to display some LEDs on the Dash to alert the driver of any faults that may occur in the car. It is a safety feature for rules and also helps with debugging. I learnt a lot about using Altium and how to route a board and look forward to designing more.</p>
