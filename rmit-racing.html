<body>
    <p>At the beginning of 2022, I joined the RMIT Racing team, hoping to learn some skills and build on my knowledge in the realm of electronics. In August, I was promoted to Head Electrical Engineer and guided my team to complete a wiring harness for our FSAE Combustion Car to compete in December 2022 for the last time as a combustion team.</p>
    <p>This project was a huge learning curve for me as the only experience I had with electronics stemmed from my part-time job at Jaycar Electronics and personal hobby-level experience. A lot of problem-solving was done to get this car up and running. I spent a lot of time splicing, crimping and reading data-sheets to correct mistakes. I also participated in the Chassis Dyno where we tested the car and coded all of the MoTeC ECU and PDM dependencies through M1 tune.</p>
    <p>At the 2022 FSAE Competition in Winton, we placed 2nd in the Combustion category and 1st in the Endurance event after problem-solving to get the car running at the last possible minute! In 2023, I will continue on as the Head Electrical Engineer with a new merged team, RMIT Motorsport, where we will be producing a new EV car.</p>
